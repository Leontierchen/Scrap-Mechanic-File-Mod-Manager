This is the first release of my File-Mod Manager for Scrap Mechanic. It is meant to make installing any file mod as easy and save as possible, because it makes a backup of every file that would get overwritten by manually installing mods. It makes it easy and fast to switch between Vanilla and modded SM, Create Savegame Backups, only backing up all saves the first time, then linking to saves that havent got played in the past, to save memory. It also has a small tool inside to manage different outfits ingame. Lets say you edited your character with shirt, hat and pants etc and want to save that and create a new one. With the tool you can do that. You cant edit the outfit, just see it as a wardrobe for different outfits.
